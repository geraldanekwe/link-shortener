# Link Shortener

Basic environment requirements

- Node > v6.7.0
- https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm


## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to the root folder of the project and run `npm install`
2. After the packages are done installing, run `npm start`
3. Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## NOTE
For the simplicity of recreating this environment, I included a `.env` file with variables.
This is a big security issue and would never be ok in a production environment.
